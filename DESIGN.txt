## Welcome to the SORETTA software. This code is distributed under the GNU general public license.

This software is designed to assist structural biologists to:
*	Learn more about, and to predict, protein dynamics, folding, energetics, and transition states in enzymatic reactions as a result of enzyme motion during reaction catalysis.
*	Assist in the design process of synthetic proteins based on structure-function prediction modelling
*	Analyze protein geometries using structure simplification methods
*	Be a central module with core libraries and extra functions that can be added to the software.
